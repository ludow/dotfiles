Your dotfiles are how you personalize your system. These are mine.

## install

Run this:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/ludow/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
make install
```

## thanks

I forked [Zach Holman](http://zachholman.com) [dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles) to start building my own personalized system. It's still an inspiration to add new nuggets which help me being more efficient.
